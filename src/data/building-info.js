    description: "15 Westminister, aka 15 West, is home to the Fleet Library in addition to apartments and suites for over 500 upperclassmen. RISD's Fleet Library is one of the most beautiful spaces on campus. As the building was originally built by the Hospital Trust Bank, the library has preserved many architectureal features of the original building, including a large hanging clock that hangs in the middle of the space. Students have access to over 100,000 volumes on art and design as well as an extensive materials library. Other features of the library include study nooks, a video viewing room, and spaces for group meetings. Across from the library is the Portfolio Cafe, RISD's second largest dining hall, which also provides basic grocery items for purchase for students living in the apartments above.",
